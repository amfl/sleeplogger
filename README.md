sleeplogger
===========

Recorder and visualiser for my sleeping patterns for use with my raspberry pi and some game controllers.

Just a quick hacked-up personal project.

Sleeping is rendered as a white bar.
Repeated pressing of a 'wake up' button is interpreted as a brief stirring, and rendered as a gap in sleep.
Repeated pressing of a 'sleep' button is interpreted as insomnia, and rendered as a red bar.
